# Miles Traveled by Athletes Exploration

**Project description:**

The goal of this project was to determine how many miles each team in an athletics program traveled across a season. I had created a dataset in a previous project that contained the schedules of all teams from 2016 on that also had location of the event, whether it was a round-trip or not, and an indicator for whether the competition was played at home or not. I found a dataset online that provided the coordinates of all major college football stadiums and, while this may not have been the exact location of an away game, football stadiums are typically close enough to campus that it was within the margin of error for calculating distance traveled in miles. I had to supplement this with additional latitude and longitude values for schools that were not represented in the data to ensure that all locations that were present in the schedule dataset had coordinates available.

After merging the schedule information with the coordinates of each location competitions took place, I was able to use the geosphere and geodist packages in R to calculate distance traveled in meters for each event. I further manipulated the meters traveled metric to convert it into one-way miles traveled and round-trip miles traveled. To account for the fact that some teams typically compete in the same location for the entire span of a trip while others travel to one location and then a secondary site for the next event, the round trip indicator from the schedule dataset was used to pull either the one-way or round-trip mileage into a singular column representing 'Total Miles Traveled'. Some final cleaning steps were taken before exporting the data into an excel sheet with all scheduling information and miles traveled per trip for each athletic team in the years of 2016-2023.
